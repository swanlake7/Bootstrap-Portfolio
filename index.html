<!-- 2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

       <p>Welcome to my portfolio!
          This is a space where I introduce myself to potential collaborators, employers, and anyone who wants to connect about coding.

          For the last few years I calculated quantum numbers, synthesized chemicals, TAed, and took classes like physical chemistry.
          After a while I realized that among my diverse interests, coding is the common demonator. So I started the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp in 2019.</p>
      
      
         <p><em> Random Fact 1</em> - I'm an Atlanta Peach! The city always felt like my home even though I lived abroad when I was younger.</p>
          

          <p><em> RF 2</em> - I always think about designs and am sporatically sketching in my dark room. </p>
          

         <p> <em>RF 3 </em>- In a few years, I want to work on cybersecurity, brain-computer interface, and blockchain.</p>
